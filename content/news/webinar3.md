Our SASIP Webinar #3 with Polly Smith on 'Data Assimilation for State and Parameter Estimation' took place on Wednesday 27 October at 3pm CEST.

After briefly introducing herself and giving a summary of her research experience, Polly described how we can use data assimilation techniques to deliver improved estimates of uncertain, or poorly known, model parameters alongside the model state. She outlined the theory of joint state-parameter estimation and then discuss aspects related to practical implementation of the approach, using examples from some of her previous work. She finished by outlining the plans for her work within WP4 of SASIP.
