We complement the model development efforts of the other WPs by providing data-constrained sea ice analyses.
To meet this goal we shall develop specific and novel data assimilation (DA) methods adapted to the new continuum version of the sea ice model neXtSIM discretised using discontinuous Galerkin method. WP4 will also use state-of-the art DA and machine learning (ML) methods not used in sea ice modeling before, and develop novel approaches for the unique computational and physical features of neXtSIM. In particular we will adopt neural networks and the new frontier of hybrid DA-ML techniques to devise data-driven parameterizations that complement and enhance physically based ones.

WP4 is a bridge between the other WPs and is structured along four tasks reflecting the diverse DA and ML challenges prompted by the other WPs, preparing neXtSIM to exploit the new and constantly growing sets of sea ice data:

 - DA strategies adapted to models using a discontinuous galerkin numerical method
 - DA for parameter estimation: sub-grid and sea ice–ocean coupling parameterizations
 - ML and hybrid DA-ML for parameterization design and parameter estimation
 - DA for feature data
